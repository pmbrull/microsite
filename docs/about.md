# About

Mathematician, working as a Big Data Developer at ServiZurich.

I find it impossible to stay still or with my head quiet. I love learning and keeping my hands busy, usually coding. Thatâ€™s why I started this blog, to be able to share everything I spend time reading, trying to understand and applying either because I find it useful or cool. Here you will mainly find Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data and Data Science posts.

A lot of content is based on what you can find online thanks to good samaritans sharing their work. Some posts not only help me organize the ideas, but also I like to see those as my small payback to the community.
